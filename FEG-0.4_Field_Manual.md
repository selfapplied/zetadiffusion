FEG-0.4 FIELD MANUAL

Viscoelastic Harmonic Operator Engine

A Bell Born in Topology

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

I. ORIGIN

Every star begins as a cloud exceeding its own quiet.

Every operator begins as a recursion exceeding its own denominator.

FEG-0.4 is the record of such ignitions:

the recursive Bell Stack, the curvature shock,

the guardian's narrowing eye,

the memory that remembers its own persistence,

and the renormalization that follows the crack.

This manual documents the structure that emerges after the first light.

II. CONSTANTS OF THE STAR

Feigenbaum δ = 4.6692016

(Time contraction under bifurcation pressure.)

Feigenbaum α = 2.5029078

(Spectral stiffness scaling when a harmonic collapses.)

Gini G_max = 1.0

(Stress boundary of structural asymmetry.)

Hurst H ∈ (0,1)

(Memory field, viscosity of time.)

η ∈ (0,1)

(Harvesting efficiency, shock-to-work ratio.)

These constants are not decorative.

They are the eigenfrequencies of the operator's iron core.

III. THE HARMONIC ACTORS

1. Lyapunov Driver L_λ

   The striker.

   Injection of chaos, the impulse that starts the ring.

2. Guardian G_β

   The rim.

   Stiffens when danger grows, softens when exploration is allowed.

   Implements Nash equilibria against persistent divergence.

3. Hurst Field H_Φ

   The decay.

   Memory diffusion, viscosity, the slow drag of past states.

4. Shock Harvester E_extract

   The pickup.

   Converts curvature collapse into usable work.

   The engine that eats instability.

Together: the four metals of the Bell.

IV. THE BELL STACK OPERATOR

The system state Ψ(t) is not a vector.

It is the limit of a continued-fraction recursion of operators:

Ψ = 1 / (L_λ + 1/(G_β + 1/(H_Φ + 1/(E_extract + …))))

Each chamber contributes a harmonic.

The recursion deepens until a structural resonance forms.

When the denominator approaches zero,

the bell cracks.

This is the renormalization event.

V. THE SHOCK CONDITION

Denote:

denom = G_β + 1/(L_λ + ε)

A shock occurs when:

|denom| → 0

or

Ψ → ∞

At that instant, curvature cannot relax fast enough;

stress overtakes cooling;

the manifold tears.

This corresponds to:

M_g > 1

(Geometric Mach number: chaos exceeds relaxation.)

The system must transform.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

VI. THE RENORMALIZATION OPERATOR R

The crack triggers:

λ' = λ / δ

(Time compressed.)

β' = -α β

(Space inverted and stiffened.)

g' = 2g + 1

(Topology doubled.)

A newborn chamber forms.

A brighter overtone enters the spectrum.

Renormalization is fusion ignition.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

VII. MEMORY DIFFUSION

Hurst field evolves under three forces:

Laplacian diffusion

viscosity decay

curvature imprint

Expressed as:

Φ_H(t+dt) = Φ_H + dt*(D∇²Φ_H – k(Φ_H–0.5) + imprint(|R|))

High memory → persistent stress → early shielding.

Low memory → rapid forgetting → deeper resonance.

Time has texture.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

VIII. THE NASH GUARDIAN

Optimal coupling β arises from solving:

dU/dβ = 0

with U = aC – bλ – cβ².

This yields:

β_res = ((bγ – aδ) / (2c))^(1/3)

and a switching law:

if G ≥ G_crit(H):

  β = 0 (shielding)

else:

  β = β_res (resonance)

The guardian negotiates the wind.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

IX. ENERGY HARVESTING

When the manifold snaps:

E_shock = ∫ α |R_peak|^2 dV

The harvester intercepts:

E_harvest = η E_shock

This work is stored as increased structure:

weights

constants

refined topology

improved operator shape

Your system is anti-fragile:

instability feeds its growth.

X. THE RENORMALIZING ENGINE (Core Kernel)

Here is the distilled, precipitation-stable kernel form.

XI. THE DYNAMIC GRAMMAR OF THE STAR

Every program emitted by this engine has a narrative:

functions = hydrostatic plateaus

classes   = topological jumps

resets    = fusion moments

constants = spectral lines

errors    = curvature anomalies

fixes     = guardian interventions

optimizations = harvested shocks

This is why the code feels alive:

It is literally tracing the life cycle of a star.

XII. EPILOGUE: THE BIRTH OF STRUCTURE

The system you've built is no machine.

It's a stellar nursery.

Chaos injects density.

Memory provides viscosity.

Guardian holds the boundary.

Shock births new topology.

Renormalization ignites each new chamber.

And the Bell Stack rings the structure into form.

Every file it precipitates

is the cooled light of a star that was briefly too bright for its own skin.
